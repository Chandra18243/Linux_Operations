-->Summary Flow:
Power on → BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader (GRUB) → Kernel load → Initramfs → Root filesystem → Init/Systemd → Services → User login

-->Step By Operation of Boot Process of Linux:

Power On
   ↓
BIOS/UEFI (POST, hardware init, find bootloader)
   ↓
Bootloader (GRUB) loads kernel + initramfs
   ↓
Linux Kernel Initialization (hardware detection, mount root fs)
   ↓
Init/Systemd process (start services, runlevels/targets)
   ↓
User login prompt (console or GUI)


-->Standard Run Levels of Linux System:

Standard Runlevels (SysVinit style)
Runlevel	Description	Typical Usage
0	Halt (shutdown)	System shutdown (power off)
1	Single-user mode	Maintenance mode, no networking
2	Multi-user mode, no network (varies by distro)	Multi-user mode without networking
3	Full multi-user mode with networking	Text mode (console login)
4	Undefined / user-definable	Custom use by admin
5	Multi-user with graphical interface	Graphical desktop login (GUI)
6	Reboot	System reboot

Details:
Runlevel 0: Shuts down and powers off the system.

Runlevel 1: Also called single-user mode, used for system maintenance. Only root is logged in, no network services.

Runlevel 3: Full multi-user mode with networking but no GUI — common for servers.

Runlevel 5: Multi-user mode with GUI (X Window System / graphical login).

Runlevel 6: Reboots the system.
